# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Follow Spec-Kit Plus–driven workflows
Every aspect of book creation, from planning to implementation, MUST adhere to Spec-Kit Plus–driven workflows. This ensures a structured approach and consistent output.

### Write clearly for developers (intermediate level)
All content, explanations, and code examples MUST be written with an intermediate-level developer audience in mind. Clarity, precision, and practical relevance are paramount.

### Maintain technical accuracy and reproducibility
All technical information and code examples MUST be accurate and fully reproducible. Code examples should be verifiable and consistent with the documented process.

### Ensure transparency in AI-generated content
The use of AI in content generation MUST be transparently disclosed. AI-generated sections or assistance should be clearly identified to maintain authorial integrity.

## Key Standards

- Markdown formatted for Docusaurus
- Verified, executable code examples
- Consistent terminology and structure
- Each chapter starts with a Spec-Kit Plus–style spec

## Constraints

- Length: 20,000–30,000 words
- Minimum 8 chapters with examples/tutorials
- Must build and deploy on GitHub Pages without errors
- Tools: Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, Docusaurus, GitHub

<h2>Success Criteria</h2>

- Book compiles cleanly in Docusaurus
- Live GitHub Pages deployment works
- All examples reproducible
- Readability: Grade 9–12
- No broken links or failing code blocks

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, explicit approval from stakeholders, and a clear migration plan for any affected processes or artifacts. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity in any solution MUST be justified and documented.
